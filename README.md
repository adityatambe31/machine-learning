# Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2025: Agentic AI, Generative AI & Reinforcement Learning  
### 📘 Personal Notes, Summaries & Learning Journey

This repository contains my structured notes, Python code, summary sheets, and explanations from completing the **Udemy course: “Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2025: Agentic AI, Gen AI & RL.”**  
I spent **5 months** completing the course while building hands-on projects and understanding how modern AI systems work behind the scenes.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### **1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
I gained a strong foundation in RL through:
- Q-Learning  
- Deep Q-Learning  
- Deep Convolutional Q-Learning  
- A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)  
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)  
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)

**Key takeaway:**  
I learned how an AI agent can learn optimal behavior through trial & error using rewards, and I implemented several RL agents from scratch.

---

### **2. Generative AI & Transformer-Based Models**
I worked with:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Transformer architecture  
- GPT-style text generation  
- LoRA & QLoRA fine-tuning  
- Prompt engineering + model adaptation

**Key takeaway:**  
I learned how modern generative models interpret text, generate responses, and how to fine-tune them efficiently.

---

### **3. Agentic AI Development**
I built AI agents that:
- Plan tasks  
- Make autonomous decisions  
- Use foundation models  
- Interact with environments or tools  
- Respond adaptively to user inputs  

**Key takeaway:**  
Agentic AI isn’t just responding — it **thinks, plans, and acts**. I learned how full AI agents are structured and deployed.

---

### **4. AI Project Engineering**
Across the 5 months, I completed several real projects:
- RL game-playing agent  
- Optimization & decision-making agents  
- GenAI-powered chatbot  
- Self-driving simulation logic  
- A multi-step reasoning agent using LLMs  

**Key takeaway:**  
I became comfortable taking an AI idea from **concept → code → training → evaluation → deployment**.

---

### **5. Python Skills & ML Engineering**
Throughout the course, I strengthened my coding and AI engineering workflows:
- Python for ML  
- Jupyter notebooks  
- Working with environments  
- Visualizing training metrics  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Debugging AI behavior
